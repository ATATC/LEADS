## Introduction

For project information, please see README.

## Breakdowns

**Phase I** includes a basic instrumentation that has at least the following functions.

- A speed indicator
- A voltage indicator
- A lap time indicator
- A camera image merging and streaming system

Phase I can be broken down into two parts: **hardware** and **software**.

### Hardware Components

In order to have these goals realized, a number of specific hardware components are currently proposed to be purchased. These components including the specifications are mentioned below.

#### Main Controller

For performance and ease of use reasons, **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB** or **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB** are selected.

For all specifications of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B serial, see https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications.

The main controller runs a minimum graphical Linux system (Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu).

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/kb/linux-installation) is also needed for the purpose of camera image merging and streaming.

#### Monitor

A 7- to 10-inch monitor with an HDMI port.

#### Wheel Speed Sensor

Any **Hall sensor** that supports GPIO is appropriate.

In order to support future features, at least **2 wheel speed sensors** are required.

#### Camera

Any USB camera.

In order to support future features, at least **3 cameras** are required.

### Software Components

As it is shown in the project structure, the software part is written mostly in ***Python3***. All packages will be published on [**PyPI**](https://pypi.org/) so that the program can be installed on the main controller through *Pip*.

The program consists of 5 packages: `leads`, `leads_dashboard`, `leads_emulation`, `leads_raspberry_pi`, and `leads_vec`.

#### `leads`

This package provides an abstract framework for the system. The rest of the packages are basically implementing the framework based on the specific conditions.

Note that this package does not include any GUI.

##### `leads.comm`

This package provides a TCP connection platform that is used for the communication subsystem.

##### `leads.controller`

This package provides an abstract layer of the controllers and devices.

#### `leads_dashboard`

This package includes a general GUI platform. It relies on [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui).

#### `leads_emulation`

This package emulates a number of controllers and devices thus the system can be tested and modified on a regular computer without actually deploying on the main controller. It mostly implements `leads.controller`.

#### `leads_raspberry_pi`

Similar to `leads_emulation`, this package implements `leads.controller`, yet for the actual main controller.

#### `leads_vec`

This is the final package is the real entrance program that runs on the main controller. It is an executable package. In this package, everything is dedicated only to VeC cars.

## Current

By the time of this report, a basic demo of the software part is completed.
