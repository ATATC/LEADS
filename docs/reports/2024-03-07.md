## Tasks

### Add Historical Traces to the Map (#72)

#### Format

To better analyze and improve driving strategies, we want the historical traces to be displayed as a floating layer on
the map.

We have the GPS data from last year in a file, we want to somehow transform that data into a CSV file with only
latitudes and longitudes. We want to keep the following format in case we want to add amplitude info in the future.

```csv
[LATITUDE];[LONGITUDE],[LATITUDE];[LONGITUDE],[LATITUDE];[LONGITUDE],...
43.653225;-79.383186,43.653225;-79.383186,43.653225;-79.383186,...
```

The new GPS data since LEADS has taken over this duty will be all like this.

#### Visualization

To visualize the path, we upload this to the [website](https://leads-vec-rc.projectneura.org) and add a layer on the
map. The specific tech stack is yet to be determined.
