# LEADS: Lightweight Embedded Assisted Driving System

LEADS is a system designed for VeC.

LEADS only supports two-wheel configurations: single rear wheel (SRW) mode and dual rear wheel (DRW) mode.

Python is generally not the best choice for writing embedded systems. We made this decision for the following reasons.

- Data analysis
- Short development cycle
- Official support for Raspberry Pi
- Low difficulty in getting started for team members

This project aims to implement the following functions:

- A basic instrumentation system
- A basic control system
- A basic communication system
- A speed recording system
- A G force recording system
- DTCS (Dynamic Traction Control System)
- ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)
- EBI (Emergency Braking Intervention)
- ATBS (Automatic Trail Braking System)
