# LEADS: Lightweight Embedded Assisted Driving System

LEADS is a system designed for VeC.

LEADS only supports two wheel configurations: single rear wheel (SRW) mode and dual rear wheel (DRW) mode.

Python is generally not the best choice for writing embedded systems. We made this decision for the following reasons.

- Data analysis
- Short development cycle
- Official support for Raspberry Pi
